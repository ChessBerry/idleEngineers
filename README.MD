# Idle Engineers CheeseBerryTweaks

Highlight working/Idle T1,T2,T3 Engineers and more on the main map with different overlay for each.
improved by ZeRen, Giebmasse and  CheeseBerry.

## Changelog from Idle Engineers to Idle Engineers CheeseBerryTweaks v1

### Behavior Changes
* Only highlight engineers that are actually idle, instead of all of them.

### Bug and compatability fixes:
* Fixed most instances of the overlay turning into a giant black square sometimes. Still happens sometimes though.
* Fixed misplacement of overlays with >100% ui scale.
